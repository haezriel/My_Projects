commit_dialog_history_messages=<?xml version\="1.0" encoding\="UTF-8"?>\n<messages>\n<message>HI THERE</message>\n<message>Last Commit (Hah) On Master Branch, few bug fixes&\#x0A;&\#x0A;Hopefully I can get people on-board to do a multi-player scrolling&\#x0A;version of this, that would be great.  Some bug fixes with&\#x0A;images/collision detection, finished the README, all done now.</message>\n<message>oops</message>\n<message>Final Commit for now&\#x0A;&\#x0A;Finished adding Sound, everything is great, I need sleep.</message>\n<message>Final Touches, Progression and End-Game Completed (for now).&\#x0A;&\#x0A;So I finished scaling the chickens, the weapons, the spells, the player&\#x0A;HP/Power as you go through levels, and the speed.  I&apos;ve also implemented&\#x0A;the end-game Duck and Endless Mode toggling, which lets you keep going&\#x0A;after you get the Duck.  There&apos;s treasure chests, there&apos;s powerups,&\#x0A;there&apos;s Pause screens, quit screens, continue screens, game-over&\#x0A;screens, we got all your screens, man.  This project took hundreds of&\#x0A;hours and was a blast.</message>\n<message>3 Weapon Types Implemented, UI aspects and Levels incoming.&\#x0A;&\#x0A;Alright, so now we have 3 different weapon types (which will upgrade as&\#x0A;we gain power-ups), 4 spells (planning on 5, but need to make sure I&\#x0A;finish other stuff first), RNG levels, scaling chickens, and scaling&\#x0A;character stats.  I&apos;ve met essentially all the low-bar stuff at this&\#x0A;point, but I want to make sure that I have a solid UI, sound, and&\#x0A;variety in levels, as well as the elusive &quot;Duck&quot;.  </message>\n<message>Added Scaling, grabbing the mouse, pause screen, and fixed some typing&\#x0A;&\#x0A;The chickens will now scale in speed, hp, damage, etc.  The player&\#x0A;scales as well, and is WAAAAY OVERTUNED at the moment, but that&apos;s ok for&\#x0A;now, since our scaling will be implemented through weapons.  The pause&\#x0A;screen will display PAUSE instead of just the default startup screen&\#x0A;when it&apos;s fully implemented.  Grabbing the mouse and replacing the&\#x0A;cursor with a graphic stemmed from my frustration while playing and&\#x0A;accidentally clicking out of the screen and dying.  Spells are fun, and&\#x0A;the game is already feeling a little addictive.  There are still some&\#x0A;issues left in 5, so I&apos;ll finish a few more things before merging with&\#x0A;Develop.</message>\n<message>Spells\! Some Random Map generation fixes, tons of animations/effects.&\#x0A;&\#x0A;By no means my final pass at spells (hopefully), but I&apos;ve put in 4&\#x0A;different spell types, which will later be modified to do varying&\#x0A;amounts of damage. The spells are contained in a separate animation&\#x0A;array, as they interact quite a lot with the Enemy entities, so bunching&\#x0A;them together with non-interactive animations for a bunch of n^2&\#x0A;operations would be terribad.  I&apos;ve decided to unlock spells by leveling&\#x0A;up, and being able to toggle through them with spacebar (will add a UI&\#x0A;element), whereas Weapons will be looted, and act as modifiers for both&\#x0A;melee and spell damage. Scaling levels and difficulty are next on my&\#x0A;priority list, alongside more map backgrounds and sprites.  I like the&\#x0A;notion of having random map generations with gradually scaling&\#x0A;difficulty, so I may just do that instead of having 10 static levels, so&\#x0A;that the player can go as high as they want, and maybe get some really&\#x0A;crazy numbers (also will be fun to see if I can break the game).</message>\n<message>Implemented HP/Power UI, attack, damage, death/loss, and some graphics.&\#x0A;&\#x0A;SPRITESHEEEEEEEEEEETSSS\!\!  They&apos;re great. I&apos;ve put in Game over/Win&\#x0A;states, and the levels are currently set to randomly generate.  I have a&\#x0A;lot of constants that I want to replace with scalable values, but things&\#x0A;are looking decent.  The graphics are homemade, so some of them are not&\#x0A;done yet.  TODO\: build in player levels and scaling values, set up an&\#x0A;end-game, and implement weapons/spells.</message>\n<message>Merge branch &apos;issue\#2.1&apos; into issue\#2.2&\#x0A;&\#x0A;Conflicts\:&\#x0A;&\#x09;GMBMD/src/gmbmd/Grid.java&\#x0A;&\#x09;GMBMD/src/gmbmd/Map.java&\#x0A;&\#x09;GMBMD/src/gmbmd/PlayingState.java&\#x0A;</message>\n</messages>
