Project 1: WSU Cipher

README:


This is a basic cipher program:

Encrypt.c
It reads bits from "plaintext.txt",
Encrypts and outputs it to "cyphertext.txt"
And generates/uses keys from "key.txt"

Valid Usage:
>./encrypt  (This runs encryption on plaintext.txt using the key in key.txt).
>./encrypt k (This does the same but randomly generates a key which is stored in key.txt).
>./encrypt d (This does the same but prints debugging information).

Decrypt.c
It reads bits from "cyphertext.txt",
Decrypts and outputs to "plaintext.txt"
And uses the key from "key.txt"

Valid Usage:
>./decrypt  (This decrypts cyphertext.txt into plaintext.txt)
>./decrypt d (This shows debugging information and outputs to output.txt instead of plaintext.txt)


Archive Contents:

	plaintext.txt - contains the plaintext before/after encryption/decryption
	cyphertext.txt - contains the encrypted text
	key.txt - contains the key
	output.txt - output file for debugging purposes (ignore)
	encrypt.c - encryption source code
	decrypt.c - decryption source code
	Makefile 
	README


TO COMPILE:

>make

TO RUN (assuming you have plaintext.txt and key.txt in your directory):
>./encrypt

>./decrypt
