CS 355 Programming Language Design
Homework 1: Turtle Interpreter

This Interpreter should be fully functional for all turtle program inputs.  The scanner.c, turtle.c, and symtab.c programs are not mine, and have not been altered.

The interpreter should respond to all erroneous input with appropiate error messages and exits.

Provided all input is correct, the interpreter should make any desired graphic.

To compile, type make, the included Makefile will do the rest.  I've included all the test cases that were initially provided. They should all work perfectly.

Archive includes:
    hw1(folder)-
        interpreter.c
        scanner.c
        scanner.h
        turtle.c
        turtle.h
        symtab.c
        symtab.h
        tests (folder)-
            (contains all the test files)
        Makefile
    README.txt
