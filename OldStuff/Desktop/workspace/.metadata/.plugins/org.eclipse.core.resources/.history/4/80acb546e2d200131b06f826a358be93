//This program will take in a file and index all the words in the file in alphabetical order,
//I wanted to implement Swing to make an interface for selecting the file to index,
//But I apparently had the wrong IDE.
//The print function can be called from here, or from inside wordIndex using List.print();
//The status updates automatically to true once the indexing is complete.
